This project is for multimedia-centric Ubuntu users.

The bash script sets up a set of PPA and other repositories and installs some
programs and libraries so the user can more easily view DVDs, videos online and
play most common types of music files.

Hit Alt + F2 and click "run in terminal" or open a terminal (Applications >
Accessories > Terminal) and run this command so that the script uses the proper
script for the version of Ubuntu you are using.

chmod +x `lsb_release -cs`.sh; ./`lsb_release -cs`.sh

See COPYING for more license details.

Enjoy!
